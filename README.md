# AutoencoderIDS
This repository tests 3 different pipelines for setting up an autoencoder to detect malware in network traffic. 
The first pipeline: Distribution Merging Preprocessor. Run main.py, PhaseII.py, and Testing.py in order. 
The second pipeline: Non-Distribution Merging, Non-Sorter Preprocessor. Run Preprocessor.py, ModelBuilding.py, and ModelTesting.py in order
The third pipeline: Non-Distribution Merging, Sorter Preprocessor. Run Preprocessor2.py, ModelBuilding2.py
The .pdf file is a poster summarizing results from testing the various pipeline.
